# MERCON Logistics Platform

The MERCON Logistics Platform is a comprehensive, enterprise-grade fleet and trip management ecosystem built for seamless operations, dispatching, and real-time live telemetry tracking.

## 🚀 System Architecture

The ecosystem consists of two primary applications communicating over a unified Postgres Database.

### 1. The Operator Web Dashboard (`frontend/web-dashboard`)
Built with **React, Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Recharts**.
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Real-time KPI cards and dynamic charts summarizing revenue, active fleet, and trip status distributions.
- **Trip Management**: End-to-end trip lifecycle control. Create trips, assign vehicles/drivers, track statuses, and view trip details.
- **Fleet & Driver Hub**: Complete CRM for managing Driver profiles (including AI risk scores and documents) and Vehicles (maintenance logs and availability).
- **Live GPS Tracking**: Uses `socket.io-client` to connect to the backend's live telemetry stream, updating driver coordinates on the map in real-time.

### 2. The API Server & WebSockets (`backend/api-server`)
Built with **Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Prisma (PostgreSQL), and Socket.io**.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based login systems for Operators (Web) and Drivers (Mobile app).
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Full CRUD endpoints powering the frontend's Trip, Driver, Vehicle, Customer, and Reporting services.
- **Socket.io Telemetry Engine**: A low-latency WebSocket server that listens for `driver:location_update` events from the mobile apps and broadcasts them directly to tracking dashboards via `trip:location_update`.

## 📦 Deployment Pipeline & Git Standards

The project uses an optimized CI/CD pipeline deploying directly to a live VPS at `mercon.tech` / `dev.mercon.tech`.

1. **Development & Target Branch:** Primary active pushes default to **`origin/ilan`**.
2. **Transfer:** Source code syncs to the VPS container host.
3. **Build & Migration:** Docker Compose rebuilds the containers (`mercon-api` and `mercon-frontend`) and executes `npx prisma migrate deploy` on container boot.
4. **Proxy:** Nginx safely routes traffic to host ports (`3051` for API, `3060` for Web Dashboard) with SSL certificates intact.

## 📡 Live Telemetry Engine (WebSockets)

One of the most advanced features is the real-time tracking engine:
1. **Driver's App** emits a `driver:location_update` over WebSockets containing `lat`, `lng`, and `speed`.
2. **Node.js Server** intercepts the payload and emits it on a dedicated trip channel `trip:location_update:{tripId}`.
3. **Operator Dashboard** subscribes to this channel on the `TripTrackingPage` and dynamically updates the UI coordinates and speed every 10 seconds without refreshing.

## 🏗️ Future Roadmap (Phase 4+)

- **Map Integration**: Integrate Mapbox or Google Maps API to visually plot the truck's coordinates on a real interactive map.
- **Driver Mobile App**: Build the React Native mobile application for the drivers to capture Proof of Delivery (POD) photos and trigger the live GPS engine.
- **Automated Invoicing**: Generate automated PDF invoices upon Trip Completion.

The API server, web dashboard, and shared-types are **npm workspaces** — one `npm install` at the root installs and links everything. The **mobile apps are a separate npm workspace** in `frontend/mobile-app` (they need their own React/React Native versions, which differ from the web dashboard's); run `npm install` in `frontend/mobile-app`.

## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started Locally

1. **Install everything** (from the repo root)
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure env** — copy `backend/api-server/.env.example` → `.env` and set `DATABASE_URL` / `JWT_SECRET` (the server fails fast if these are missing). For the dashboard, copy `frontend/web-dashboard/.env.example` → `.env`.

3. **Run the apps**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:api    # Express API  (backend/api-server)
   npm run dev:web    # Web dashboard (frontend/web-dashboard)
   npm run mobile:driver     # Expo dev server — driver app (npm install in frontend/mobile-app first)
   npm run mobile:operator   # Expo dev server — operator app
   ```

4. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build      # shared-types → api-server → web-dashboard
   ```
